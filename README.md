# mentorship-karona
Simple, students in colleges need to connect to industry experts. During corona everyone is lockdown. Use this time to conduct virtual mentorship sessions. 

## topics

_Anything and everything_ you want to learn. Raise a issue if you see a mentor for that topic. If you don't see one even then raise an issue and we'll try to find someone from our circle. If you have a student group wanting to learn something, please feel free to ask for it.

*some suggested topics*: programming, competitive coding, web development, mobile app development, services and scaling, startups, marketing, finance, design, product management and development, user interface. 


## rules
1. Only free sessions. 
2. At least 5-10 students should be in one session. Don't request for 1:1 mentorship on this forum as we'll not be able to scale that way.
3. Students have to produce (at least) one output from the session: 
	* Try to record the session, edit it with highlights and put it on Youtube. 
	* Or, write a blog with everything discussed.
	* Put up a LinkedIn post with all that you learnt from the session.
	* Anything is fine. As long as you do share what you learnt in public forum.

## how to

### if you're a mentor
If you're someone who wants to mentor student groups. 
Raise a PR with details on this file i.e. the readme file. 

*how will this work?*
This is not a continued mentorship process. You will be assigned a talk only after your acceptance. Therefore, there's no _minimum_ time commitment required for this initiative.
